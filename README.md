# Temp Bot

Temp Bot serves to provide a super easy to use boiler plate codebase for a Discord.NET bot, with support for: 

- Logging
- Dependency Injection
- Premade Extension Methods
- Discord.Addons.Hosting fully setup
- Serilog setup and ready to use with a file logger included
- Examples and easy to follow code that's heavily commented

## Config

As of right now the bot comes with a basic `appsettings.json` that allows you to configure your token and prefix

TODO:
- Permissions
- Rules Cache
- Rudimentary Database

```
{
   "token": "token"
   "prefix": "!",
}
```
